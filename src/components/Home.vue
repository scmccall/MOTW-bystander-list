        Hark, fellow keeper of stories! Are there too many Bystanders and NPCS crowding your notes that you can't keep track of them? Look no further!
      </p>
      <p>
        Creating a new Bystander can be done in seconds, and you can access your notes for each character any time you like.
      </p>
      <p>
        Go ahead and get started! Why don't you go ahead and <router-link to="/create">create a Bystander</router-link> now?
