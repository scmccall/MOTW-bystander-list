        <strong>Monster of the Week</strong> is a standalone action-horror tabletop RPG for 3-5 people. Hunt high school beasties a la Buffy the Vampire Slayer, travel the country to bring down unnatural creatures like the Winchester brothers of Supernatural, or head up the government investigation like Mulder and Scully.

Together with your fellow <strong>Hunter</strong> players, you'll search for clue, interview suspects, and kick some monster butt- all while making sure you don't die along the way!
